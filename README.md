# Dice Rolling Game

This is a simple Python-based dice rolling game that uses ASCII art to represent the faces of the dice. The program allows users to roll one or more dice, view the dice faces as ASCII art, and choose to roll again. The user input is validated to ensure that only numbers from 1 to 6 are accepted for the dice roll.

## Features

- Roll one or more dice (up to 6).
- View the result of each dice roll as ASCII art.
- Keep rolling until the user decides to stop.
- Input validation to ensure only valid choices are entered.

Enter a number from 1 to 6: 3
